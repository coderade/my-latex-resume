Software developer focused on open-source technologies, I am currently working with IOT/DevOps development at Rumo company.

Software developer with 5 years of experience, I was able to work mainly with large projects using GIS (Geographic Information System) and IOT (Internet of Things) technologies, DevOps (Deploys automation, configuration management, and so on), as well as websystems and websites for large clients in Brazil and the World.

In addition to experience in large proprietary projects, I have good experience in open-source projects always focused on following the main standards of code, quality, testability and safety.

Arch Linux User, Java Certified, I have an experience focused on Back-end/DevOps development, but I have a good knowledge of AWS stack technologies (DynamoDB, IOT, Lambda, EC2, SNS, SQS, Kinesis, among others) and technologies like Python, Ruby on Rails, JS, Node.js, PHP, Drupal, Java, React e React-Native, AngularJS e IONIC, Adobe AEM, ExtJS, PostgreSQL, MySQL and others.
