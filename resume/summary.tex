Software Engineer focused on open-source technologies, I am currently working as a Full Stack Software Engineer working remotely in projects for companies in North America in the company GeekPot It Consulting .

Software Engineer with 6 years of experience, I was able to work mainly with large projects using GIS (Geographic Information System) and IOT (Internet of Things) technologies, DevOps (Deploys automation, configuration management, and so on), as well as websystems and websites for large clients in Brazil and the World.

In addition to experience in large proprietary projects, I have good experience in open-source projects, always focused in following the main standards of code, quality, testability and safety.

In this way, whenever possible I like to share something that I am studying on my GitHub (coderade), answer some on question on the StackOverflow and StackExchange sites or create a new post on my blog (https://valde.ci)

Arch Linux User, Java Certified, I have an experience focused on Back-end/DevOps development, but I have a good knowledge of AWS stack technologies (DynamoDB, IOT, Lambda, EC2, SNS, SQS, Kinesis, among others), Containerization (Docker/docker-compose) and technologies like Python, Ruby on Rails, JS, Node.js, PHP, Drupal, Java, React/Redux and React-Native, AngularJS e IONIC, Adobe AEM, ExtJS, PostgreSQL, MySQL and others.

On my daily basis I like to keep a good routine, studying, playing drums, reading, meditating and doing some sports (running, going to gym).
