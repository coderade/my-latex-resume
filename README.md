## my-latex-resume

This project contains a LaTeX template for my [resume](https://coderade.github.io/resume/valdeci-resume.pdf) based on 
the [posquit0](https://github.com/posquit0) [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/coderade/my-latex-resume) project.

This project is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean,
semantic markup.

## Quick Start

* [**Edit Résumé on OverLeaf.com**](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/awesome-cv/tvmzpvdjfqxp)

**_Note:_ Above services do not guarantee up-to-date source code of Awesome CV**


## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```

This should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``
